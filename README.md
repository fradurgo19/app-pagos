## Database Schema

### Tables
- **profiles** - User information with roles and locations
- **utility_bills** - Bill records with all details
- **budget_thresholds** - Monthly spending limits by service type
- **notifications** - System notifications for users

### Row Level Security (RLS)
- Users can view and manage their own bills
- Area coordinators can view and approve bills in their location
- All tables have comprehensive RLS policies

## Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 18+ and npm
- Supabase account and project

### Installation

1. Clone the repository
```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd utility-bill-manager
```

2. Install dependencies
```bash
npm install
```

3. Configure environment variables
Create a `.env` file with your Supabase credentials:
```env
VITE_SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_url
VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_supabase_anon_key
```

4. Database setup
The database schema is already applied through migrations. The following tables are created:
- profiles
- utility_bills
- budget_thresholds
- notifications

5. Start the development server
```bash
npm run dev
```

6. Build for production
